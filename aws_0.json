Instead of including all of your function dependencies along with your function code in your deployment package, put them in a layer. This keeps deployment packages small and organized.\n\nTo [c=#00FF7F]separate core function logic from dependencies[/c]. separation of concerns for updates or logic change\n\nTo [c=#00FF7F]share dependencies across multiple functions[/c]. \nAfter you create a layer, you can apply it to any number of functions in your account\n\nTo use the [c=#FF5733]Lambda console code editor[/c]. you [c=#00FF7F]cant use the editor if your deployment package size is too large[/c]. Using layers reduces your package size and can unlock usage of the code editor.\n\nTo lock an [c=#FF5733]embedded SDK version[/c]. \nThe embedded SDKs may change without notice as AWS releases new services and features. You can [c=#00FF7F]lock a version of the SDK[/c] by creating a Lambda layer with the specific version needed. \n\nembedded SDK version is a collection of libraries that allow your code to interact with AWS services (like S3, DynamoDB, etc.). For example, in Node.js, its the aws-sdk package.\n[c=#00FF7F]AWS pre-packages a version of the AWS SDK in the Lambda runtime environment[/c] (e.g., Node.js, Python). This means your Lambda function code can use the SDK without including it in your deployment package ‚Äî its already there.\n\n[c=#FF5733]For Go and Rust[/c] [c=#00FF7F]we recommend against using layers[/c]. For Go and Rust , executable includes your compiled function code along with all of its dependencies. this forces to manually load additional assemblies during the initialization phase, which can increase cold start times. For optimal performance for Go and Rust functions, [c=#00FF7F]include your dependencies along with your deployment package[/c].\n\nWhen you add a layer to a function, Lambda extracts the layer contents into the [c=#FF5733]/opt[/c] directory in your functions execution environment.\nYou can include up to [c=#FF5733]five layers per function[/c]. \nyou can [c=#00FF7F]use layers only with Lambda functions deployed as a .zip file archive[/c]\n\nFor functions defined as a [c=#FF5733]container image[/c], [c=#00FF7F]package your preferred runtime and all code dependencies when you create the container image[/c]\n\nA [c=#FF5733]layer version[/c] is an immutable snapshot of a specific version of a layer. A new layer creates a new layer version with a version number of 1. Each time you publish an update to the layer, Lambda increments the version number and creates a new layer version.\n\nEvery [c=#00FF7F]layer version is identified by a unique Amazon Resource Name (ARN)[/c]. When adding a layer to the function, [c=#00FF7F]you must specify the exact layer version[/c] you want to use (for example, arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:123456789012:layer:my-layer:1).",

Start all extensions (Extension init)\n2. Bootstrap the runtime (Runtime init)\n3. Run the function's static code (Function init)\n\nIf all [c=#00FF7F]3 tasks do not complete within 10 seconds[/c], L retries Init phase during first function invocation with the configured function timeout.\nNotable exceptions: Lambda snap start, provisioned concurrency\n\n[c=#FF5733]Invoke phase[/c]\nWhen a Lf is invoked in response to a Next API request, L sends an Invoke event to the rt and to each E.\n\nThe f's timeout setting limits the duration of the entire Invoke phase. \nIf you set the f timeout as 360 seconds, the f and all E need to complete within 360 seconds. Note that there is no independent post-invoke phase. [c=#00FF7F]The duration is the sum of all invocation time (runtime + extensions) and is not calculated until the function and all extensions have finished executing.[/c] #basically they all have to call Next\nThe invoke phase ends after the runtime and all extensions signal that they are done by sending a Next API request.\n\n\n[c=#FF5733]Failures during the invoke phase[/c]\nIf the Lf crashes or times out during the Invoke phase, Lambda resets the execution environment. \nThe reset behaves like a Shutdown event. \nFirst, L shuts down the rt, then sends a Shutdown event to each registered external E. \nThe event includes the reason for the shutdown. \nIf this environment is used for a new invocation, Lambda re-initializes the E and rt together with the next invocation.\nNote that the [c=#00FF7F]Lambda reset does not clear the /tmp directory content prior to the next init phase[/c]. This behavior is consistent with the regular shutdown phase.\n\n\n[c=#FF5733]Shutdown phase[/c]\nWhen L is about to shut down the runtime, it sends a Shutdown event to each registered external E. \nE can use this time for final cleanup tasks. \nThe Shutdown event is a response to a Next API request.\n\nDuration limit: The maximum duration of the Shutdown phase depends on the configuration of registered extensions:\n0 ms ‚Äì A function with no registered extensions\n500 ms ‚Äì A function with a registered internal extension\n2,000 ms ‚Äì A function with one or more registered external extensions\nIf the runtime or an extension does not respond to the Shutdown event within the limit, Lambda ends the process using a [c=#FF5733]SIGKILL signal[/c].\n\n[c=#FF5733]Lambda freeze[/c] - The environment maybe frozen for anticipated next call. When the function is invoked again, Lambda thaws the environment for reuse\nDuring freeze\nObjects declared outside of the function's handler method remain initialized\n/tmp directory content remains when the execution environment is frozen\n\n\n[c=#FF5733]Background process[/c]\n[c=#00FF7F]processes or callbacks that were initiated by Lf and did not complete when the f ended resume if L reuses the E environment[/c]. Make sure that any background processes or callbacks in your code are complete before the code exits.\n",
